## My process
I first wrote the whole content with basic html elements. I focused more on symantic html style. Then slowly I added more divs, breakpoints, font size, padding, margin etc. whenever required.   
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind css


### What I learned

During this challenge I learnd new technique of customising the underline style. It was nice to make it using background image, gradient, width and position properties.
